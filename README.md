Requires Call of the Wild to run

Features:
- Mindchemist Alchemist archetype
- Mutation Warrior Fighter archetype
- Extra Discovery feat
- move and swift action bardic performance for sensei monk and evangelist cleric

Details:

Mindchemist's Perfect Recall affects only Knowledge (Arcana) and Knowledge (World).
Mindchemist loses first instance of poison resistance instead of poison use that does not exist in this game.
This makes it so it does not stack with any other archetype right now, which is actually correct per pnp.

Mutation Warrior stacks with alchemist in a following way: he stacks completely for the purpose of both qualifying
and scaling for discoveries, but only those that can be selected by his Mutagen Discovery. His full level adds duration
to the mutagen but only after he gets his mutagen at level 3(I might change that, but I am not sure which way I prefer it).
Mutation Warrior does not qualify for Extra Discovery.

Sensei and evangelist get move and swift bardic performance at level 7 and 13, as I believe it should be per pnp rule.
This component can be turned off in settings.
