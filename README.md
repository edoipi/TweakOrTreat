- Arcane Discovery arcanist exploit
- move and swift action bardic performance for ocean's echo oracle, sensei monk and evangelist cleric

Details:

Mindchemist's Perfect Recall affects both "Knowledge" and "Lore" skills.
Mindchemist loses first instance of poison resistance instead of poison use that does not exist in this game.
This makes it so it does not stack with any other archetype right now, which is actually correct per pnp.

Mutation Warrior stacks with alchemist in a following way: he stacks completely for the purpose of both qualifying
and scaling for discoveries, but only those that can be selected by his Mutagen Discovery. His full level adds duration
to the mutagen but only after he gets his mutagen at level 3(I might change that, but I am not sure which way I prefer it).
Mutation Warrior does not qualify for Extra Discovery.

Wild Stalker required some changes, to adapting it to the game engine and to actually make it work since none proof read 
it before publishing.
There is no vision/darkness system in the game so everyone receives 2 perception bonus level 1.
Quarry, greater quarry and capstone were all useless as they depend of features traded out, so they got replaced
with greater rage, tireless rage and mighty rage.
While the text mentions getting 8 rage powers total the listed progression didn't match(one of the powers would be at level 21)
and the progression was very uneven, so I changed it to be every other level.

Ocean' Echo has no race requirements. Instead of pied piping she gets greater song of discord.

Arcane Discovery exploit is not accessible for exploiter wizard.

Sensei and evangelist get move and swift bardic performance at level 7 and 13, as I believe it should be per pnp rule.
This component can be turned off in settings.
